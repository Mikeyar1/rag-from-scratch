Good sleep hygiene involves creating habits that support restful sleep.
Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day strengthens the sleep-wake cycle.
Keeping the bedroom cool, quiet, and dark helps signal to the body that it is time to rest.
Avoiding screens for at least 30 minutes before bed reduces blue light exposure, which can delay sleep onset.
Regular physical activity, when done earlier in the day, promotes deeper and more restorative sleep.
